# Image-Classification

### Image Classification Repository 🖼️
This repository contains implementations of various deep learning models for image classification. 

These models have been implemented based on prominent research papers to enhance understanding of classification tasks in computer vision and deep learning architectures.

#### Structure 📂
The project is structured as follows:

- data folder: Contains the image datasets for training and testing.
- src folder: Contains the implementation code for key deep learning models, including:
  - AlexNet
  - VGG16
  - ResNet
  - Vision Transformer (ViT)
